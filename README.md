Infertility can affect both men and women, and it's more common than most people think. For females, common causes include ovulation disorders, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, blocked fallopian tubes, or hormonal imbalances. For males, issues like low sperm count, poor sperm motility, abnormal sperm shape, or blockages in the reproductive tract can affect fertility.

Modern fertility clinics, like Trinity IVF in Ahmedabad, provide detailed diagnostic tests to identify the root cause in both partners. Based on the findings, treatment can include lifestyle changes, medications, IUI, IVF, or even surgical interventions like laparoscopy or hysteroscopy. In some male cases, sperm retrieval techniques are also used for severe infertility.

The key is early diagnosis and a personalized treatment plan. In many cases, infertility can be successfully managed or overcome with the right care. Emotional support also plays a crucial role, as infertility can be a stressful journey for couples. Clinics that offer a holistic and compassionate approach can make a huge difference.
